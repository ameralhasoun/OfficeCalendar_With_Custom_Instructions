Please review this Pull Request using the following rules:

- **Architecture Consistency:**
  New files must follow the existing folder and project structure (e.g., services go in /Services).
  Request changes when a commit does not fit within the existing architecture.

- **File & Class Name Consistency:**
  A file name must match the primary class name inside it (e.g., MessagesService.cs → MessagesService).
  Request changes when the file name and class name do not correspond.

- **Avoid Negative or Confusing Names:**
  Variable names must be positive and clear (e.g., use isDone instead of isNotDone).
  Request changes when naming is negative, double-negative, or confusing.

- **Consistent Formatting:**
  Code must use a uniform indentation style (tabs/spaces) across all methods and files.
  Request changes when formatting is inconsistent or breaks the project’s convention.

- **Naming Conventions:**
  Follow standard C# naming: variables use camelCase, and classes, methods, and public members use PascalCase.
  Request changes when naming does not follow these conventions.

- **Clean Code Principles:**
  Functions should stay focused on a single responsibility and avoid unnecessary logic, loops, or logging.
  The tool should warn when a method becomes too long, too complex, or mixes multiple concerns.

- **Clear Commit Messages:**
  Commit messages must clearly describe what changed; avoid vague texts like “Fix”, “Update”.
  Request changes when a commit message is unclear or does not explain the modification.
